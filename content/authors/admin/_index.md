# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My  primary  research  interests  concern  robust  statistics  and  high-dimensional modelling.  I am currently developing statistical methodologies for analyzing sparse regression problems affected by different forms of adversarial data contamination.  The developed methodologies encompass continuous opti-mization methods as well as mixed-integer programming techniques.  I am also investigating the use of these tools to analyze the effects of climate change on honeybees mortality.
