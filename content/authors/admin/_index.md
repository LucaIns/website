# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: My  primary  research  interests  concern  robust  statistics and high-dimensional modeling. During my PhD, I developed statistical methodologies for analyzing sparse regression problems affected by different forms of adversarial data contamination.  The developed methodologies encompass continuous optimization methods as well as mixed-integer programming techniques.  I applied these tools to analyze biomedical data and to investigate the main possible drivers of honey bee colony loss.

<!-- ***I would like to think of myself as a scientist, who happens largely to specialise in the use of statistics*** – David Cox   -->

My  primary  research  interests  concern  robust  statistics and high-dimensional modeling. 
I am currently part of the research group of [Stéphane Guerrier](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/faculty/all/stephane-guerrier/) and [Maria-Pia Victoria-Feser](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/research/faculty/all/maria-pia-victoria-feser/) at the [Geneva School of Economics and Management - Université de Genève](https://www.unige.ch/gsem/en/).

I obtained my PhD (cum laude), with a thesis on *"Approaches for Outlier Detection in Sparse High-Dimensional Regression Models"*, where I developed statistical methodologies for analyzing sparse regression problems affected by different forms of adversarial data contamination.  
The developed methodologies encompass continuous optimization methods as well as mixed-integer programming techniques.  
I applied these tools to analyze biomedical data and to investigate the main possible drivers of honey bee colony loss.

Between 2019 and 2020 I spent a period in the United States as a visiting scholar at Penn State University, where I worked with [Runze Li](http://www.personal.psu.edu/ril4/) and [Francesca Chiaromonte](https://sites.psu.edu/chiaromonte/).
In 2017 I had a traineeship at the Joint Research Center of the European Commission, where I worked with [Domenico Perrotta](https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/person/domenico-perrotta),
and I received a M.Sc. (cum laude) from the University of Parma, where I worked with [Marco Riani](http://riani.it/) on a thesis entitled *"A Modern Approach to Robust Regression"*.
I am also a developer of the [FSDA MATLAB Toolbox](https://github.com/UniprJRC/FSDA) and a member of the [Robust Statistics Acedemy](http://rosa.unipr.it/index.html).
